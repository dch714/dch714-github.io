    <td>In future, I have to be more confident, and rather than asking and distracting others around me, this will develop my individual computing skills, and will allow me to learn from my own mistakes. I should continue to help others, because then I will have respect, and when I need help then they will help me back. I must be careful with the formulae to not get muddled up, because then it becomes very difficult.</td>
